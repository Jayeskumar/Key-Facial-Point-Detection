# Key-Facial-Point-Detection
 Key Facial Detection for Constructing Emotion AI model created using python
 
 <bold>Objective</bold>
 The objective of our model is to predict keypoint positions on face images. This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:
<ul>tracking faces in images and video</ul>
<ul>analysing facial expressions</ul>
<ul>detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis</ul>
<ul>biometrics / face recognition</ul>

<italic> Detecing facial keypoints is a very challenging problem.  Facial features vary greatly from one individual to another, and even for a single individual, there is a large amount of variation due to 3D pose, size, position, viewing angle, and illumination conditions. Computer vision research has come a long way in addressing these difficulties, but there remain many opportunities for improvement.</italic>
